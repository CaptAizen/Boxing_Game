Pit of despair fires cannonballs at you, hit them out with the gold club. 
Button opens the gate but so does a collider.
The keys for the rest fo the gates weren't finished

Tower is supposed to drop down on bad choices but bounce you up slightly before crashing you
When you stand on the platforms music plays and the targets show up to the beats of the music

I really wish I hadn't given up on this project before I began. I did the substance painter last and it surprised me.
making the textures wasn't actually that bad.

Thank you for everything. You have been more than patient, and always believed I could make it eventually if I put in the work.

Weird bug on my Unity where the audio is automatically disabled when I go into game mode. Couldn't fix it.
The sound is playing if you check the audio sources but...
I hope it works on your computer.
Two songs, breaking sounds for the targets, cannon fire, and footsteps.
Not as cool as it could've shouldve been but. It's been an interesting semester.
Hope you have a great Christmas. Peace.

Thomas
